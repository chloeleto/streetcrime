# Requirements

## User Needs

### User stories
TODO: Write brief user stories to explain how various actors would interact with the system to accomplish a goal.
    Express these in the form from agile development:- As a (role) I want (goal) so that (benefit).

### Actors
TODO: List and describe the actors/users for this product.

### Use Cases
TODO: Describe each use case (at least one per team member).
    Give each use case a unique ID, e.g. UC1, UC2, ...
    Summarise these using the use-case template below.

| TODO: USE-CASE ID e.g. UC1, UC2, ... | TODO: USE-CASE NAME | 
| -------------------------------------- | ------------------- |
| **Description** | TODO: Goal to be achieved by use case and sources for requirement |
| **Actors** | TODO: List of actors involved in use case |
| **Assumptions** | TODO: Pre/post-conditions if any</td></tr>
| **Steps** | TODO: Interactions between actors and system necessary to achieve goal |
| **Variations** | TODO: OPTIONAL - Any variations in the steps of a use case |
| **Non-functional** | TODO: OPTIONAL - List of non-functional requirements that the use case must meet. |
| **Issues** | TODO: OPTIONAL - List of issues that remain to be resolved |

| TODO: USE-CASE ID e.g. UC1, UC2, ... | TODO: USE-CASE NAME |  
| -------------------------------------- | ------------------- | 
| **Description** | A pedestrian wants to access real-time data about pedestrian-related crime in areas they frequently walk in order to make informed decisions about which| areas are the safest to walk through. | 
| **Actors** | - Primary Actor: Pedestrian (User)  |
| |- Supporting Actors: Local Law Enforcement (providing crime data), Mobile App or Website Interface (delivers crime data to the pedestrian), Data Aggregation System |(collects and compiles data) | 
| **Assumptions** | - The pedestrian has access to a device (smartphone, computer) that can access crime data.|  
||- Crime data is up-to-date, accurate, and available for the areas the pedestrian frequents.|  
||- The pedestrian knows how to use the app or website interface. </td></tr> 
| **Steps** | 1. Pedestrian opens a mobile app or website that provides crime data.  |
||2. Pedestrian enters or selects their frequently walked areas (e.g., home, work, park).  |
||3. The system retrieves and displays crime data for pedestrian-related crimes in those areas.  |
||4. Pedestrian reviews the crime data, which may include types of crimes, frequency, and trends over time.  |
||5. Pedestrian decides on the safest routes or areas based on the information provided. | 
| **Variations** | 1. If the pedestrian is in a new area, the app may suggest nearby areas with the least pedestrian-related crime based on the data available.  |
||2. If there’s no recent data for a specific area, the app may display a warning or prompt the pedestrian to check again later. | 
| **Non-functional** | - Performance: The app or website should load crime data within 3 seconds.  |
||- Usability: The user interface must be intuitive and easy to navigate for pedestrians of all ages.  |
||- Accessibility: The app/website should be accessible to people with disabilities (e.g., text-to-speech for vision-impaired users). | 
| **Issues** | - Limited community engagement or resistance to policing initiatives could hinder program effectiveness.  |
||- Budget constraints could limit the number of officers available for community patrols.  |
||- Inconsistent crime data or lack of updated information could lead to ineffective deployment of resources. | 


TODO: Your Use-Case diagram should include all use-cases.

## Software Requirements Specification
### Functional requirements
TODO: create a list of functional requirements. 
    e.g. "The system shall ..."
    Give each functional requirement a unique ID. e.g. FR1, FR2, ...
    Indicate which UC the requirement comes from.


### Non-Functional Requirements
TODO: Consider one or more [quality attributes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO/IEC_9126) to suggest a small number of non-functional requirements.
Give each non-functional requirement a unique ID. e.g. NFR1, NFR2, ...

Indicate which UC the requirement comes from.
