# Project Proposal

## Business Case

### Problem statement
Bristol experiences a range of street crime incidents, impacting the safety of residents, business owners, and visitors.
Current resources, such as national crime maps, provide data but lack the depth of analysis specific to Bristol, which limits their usefulness for local decision-making. This project seeks to address the need for a Bristol-focused crime mapping solution that provides up-to-date, localised crime data, allowing users to make safer travel and business decisions. By visualising crime hotspots, this project aims to empower community members and support city planners in reducing crime frequency and impact in Bristol.

### Business benefits
- Reduction in street crime incidents through increased awareness and safer route planning.
- Premium access to this mapped data could be monetised by offering specific details on crime trends and hot spots.
- Data insights could support city planners and law enforcement in developing preventive measures and optimising patrol routes.
- Partnership opportunities with GPS and navigation service providers to help users avoid high-risk areas in real time.

### Options Considered  
Currently, websites exist that map crime incidents across the UK, but they often cover broad regions.
For example, national crime maps offer data that may not cater specifically to Bristols needs. An example of this is Police.uk
Bristol-focused organizations would likely prefer localized data thats more affordable and relevant to them, in contrast to general UK crime data offered at high prices.

### Expected Risks
Risks include maintaining up-to-date and accurate crime data, as outdated information would undermine the projects credibility.
Additionally, attracting and retaining the target audience (Bristol residents and local business owners) may be challenging if they already rely on other sources for similar information.
