## Business Case

### Problem statement
Bristol experiences a range of street crime incidents which impact not only the safety of residents and businesses, but the socioeconomic status of the area. Current resources, such as national crime maps, provide data but lack the depth of analysis specific to Bristol. By creating a website tailored to the local area, we will be able to offer safety tips or resources linked to specific crimes, e.g., when the user clicks on an area with a high number of burglaries, they can receive practical advice on home security and/or to local police crime prevention programs. This addresses the need for a Bristol-focused crime mapping solution that provides localised crime data to appeal to the users' needs, rather than a large database of unfiltered and unnecessary information. For example, a business that is looking to establish a Bristol-based location does not need to know statistics on home burglaries. However, with the correct guidance from the website, we can help to facilitate the development of new business in up-and-coming areas. A website that clearly outlines crime trends and types can help potential entrepreneurs decide where to open stores, restaurants, or other businesses. This can also protect pre-existing businesses by allowing the owners to see when and where incidents are most likely to occur, leading to adjustments such as altering operating hours, investing in security equipment, or participating in local crime prevention programs. Local council can also use the website to focus police patrols, initiate neighborhood watch programs, or fund youth centers and other community-building initiatives that may deter crime, as well as allocating funds for improved lighting, better pedestrian paths, or the installation of security cameras. 

### Business benefits
- Homebuyers can use this business to assess the long-term property value trends to possibly identify areas where improvements to safety may boost future value. 
- Provide quick access to crime data potentially helping future home owners make educated choices about about where to live, especially those prioritising family safety. 
- Businesses, especially retail, hospitality, and service providers, can identify safe, high-traffic areas to attract customers without the concern of high crime affecting foot traffic. 
- Understanding crime patterns enables businesses to reduce risks associated with theft, vandalism, and similar incidents, which can help lower insurance costs and prevent property damage.

### Options Considered  
National websites currently provide safety information and crime data for homebuyers in the UK. However, these platforms usually cover large areas and lack detailed specific insights for Bristol’s. For example, sites like police.uk offer broad crime data but no in-depth, localised information that communities in Bristol may need. 

Homeowners in Bristol would likely benefit from a dedicated resource which offers precise data to support more informed decisions. A Bristol focused platform could deliver insights that are not just highly relevant but also cost-effective, address local crimes that are often overlooked by broader, national resources.  

### Expected Risks
Risks could arise with this project, one concern being data inaccuracies. Relying on open data sources could lead to outdated information that could mislead users. Privacy issues are also a factor to be considered. This is due to the fact that presenting localised crime data could create sensitivities if areas feel unfairly represented.  

Additionally, there’s the risk that users may misinterpret data without proper context, this could lead to misconceptions about certain areas. As this site will depend on external data sources, any changes in data availability could possibly impact the functionality of the website. Another point to add is if a certain area in Bristol has one person who is actively committing crimes, the website could make the entire area look as if it is heavy with crime which could cause issues for those who live in the area.
