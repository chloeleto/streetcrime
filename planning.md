## Business Case

### Problem statement
Bristol experiences a range of street crime incidents which impact not only the safety of residents and businesses, but the socioeconomic status of the area. Current resources, such as national crime maps, provide data but lack the depth of analysis specific to Bristol. By creating a website tailored to the local area, we will be able to offer safety tips or resources linked to specific crimes, e.g., when the user clicks on an area with a high number of burglaries, they can receive practical advice on home security and/or to local police crime prevention programs. This addresses the need for a Bristol-focused crime mapping solution that provides localised crime data to appeal to the users' needs, rather than a large database of unfiltered and unnecessary information. For example, a business that is looking to establish a Bristol-based location does not need to know statistics on home burglaries. However, with the correct guidance from the website, we can help to facilitate the development of new business in up-and-coming areas. A website that clearly outlines crime trends and types can help potential entrepreneurs decide where to open stores, restaurants, or other businesses. This can also protect pre-existing businesses by allowing the owners to see when and where incidents are most likely to occur, leading to adjustments such as altering operating hours, investing in security equipment, or participating in local crime prevention programs. Local council can also use the website to focus police patrols, initiate neighborhood watch programs, or fund youth centers and other community-building initiatives that may deter crime, as well as allocating funds for improved lighting, better pedestrian paths, or the installation of security cameras. 

### Business benefits
- Homebuyers can use this business to assess the long-term property value trends to possibly identify areas where improvements to safety may boost future value. 
- Provide quick access to crime data potentially helping future home owners make educated choices about about where to live, especially those prioritising family safety. 
- Businesses, especially retail, hospitality, and service providers, can identify safe, high-traffic areas to attract customers without the concern of high crime affecting foot traffic. 
- Understanding crime patterns enables businesses to reduce risks associated with theft, vandalism, and similar incidents, which can help lower insurance costs and prevent property damage.

### Options Considered  
Currently, websites exist that map crime incidents across the UK, but they often cover broad regions.
For example, national crime maps offer data that may not cater specifically to Bristols needs. An example of this is Police.uk
Bristol-focused organizations would likely prefer localized data thats more affordable and relevant to them, in contrast to general UK crime data offered at high prices.

### Expected Risks
Risks include maintaining up-to-date and accurate crime data, as outdated information would undermine the projects credibility.
Additionally, attracting and retaining the target audience (Bristol residents and local business owners) may be challenging if they already rely on other sources for similar information.
